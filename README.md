# deep-learning-snake
This is a short python script where an AI agent learns to play a Snake game from scratch using deep reinforcement learning. 

The code in the notebook 'Snake_keras.ipynb' defines the gaming environment and the agent, uses a reinforcement learning algorithm with a deep neural network to teach the agent, and saves the corresponding weights of the neural network into the file 'keras_20x20'. 

The file 'snake.mp4' shows an example of game played by the agent after the learning phase.
